                    <p align="justify">I sent my resume and cover letter to a job on indeed.com. I applied on indeed.com for a office coordinator position. Fake job boards, fake employer websites, and fake recruiter websites. This dataset contains 18k job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. Some job scams involve offering fake jobs through fake job postings on indeed or by presenting.</p>

                    <p align="justify">If you notice the company&#039;s information is missing, try an internet search to find a company website or email address. Apply to customer service representative, security supervisor, sales representative and more! In addition to unprofessional communication, many fake job opportunities tend to have missing contact information or vague details about the organization. Job seekers lured by fake posting a scarcity.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Indeed prides itself on being a simple and accessible platform for both employers and job seekers. To be fair, that person made the post in california. Perhaps this is a sisyphean task but what percentage of postings on say indeed/glassdoor qualify as one of these three? I applied on indeed.com for a office coordinator position. Real job, but fake listing:</p>

                    <p align="justify">I received a message prompting me to apply to a new custom posting for skills and that i would be hired regardless of its public nature as i&#039;ve already been interviewed. To be fair, that person made the post in california. Position has already been internally filled but corporate policies dictate something should be posted. How do you deal with.</p>
